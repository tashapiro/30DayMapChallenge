# 30 Day Map Challenge


## **Day 1 & 2 - Points & Lines | Manhattan Adventures**
This map is a love letter to my better half, Kristen. We spent two years living together in New York City, and over those two years we created a lot of great memories. This map outlines some of our favorite date spots and places. Map created using ggplot and OpenStreetMap (osmdata) library.
